0. I'm looking for a tool that is useful both as a tutorial
for the beginner and a functional tool for the expert.  I want
the logic of a unit calculation to be on the surface for 
inspection.  I want it to make easy things easy and hard things
easier.

1. Teach the "cross-bar" method of unit conversion

2. Provide a functioning calculator that tracks units

3. Ability to see value and unit of intermediate calculations in
the cross-bar

4. Ability to create variables with units that can be manipulated
in the calculator

5. ? Connection to plotly or desmos?
